# Product pitch

## Problem definition
Google offer a service to create maps with location mark, having such map may be useful for instance to see where your customers are mostly concentrated in a region. When one needs to create and update 200+ location marks on a google map. It can be repetitive and error prone. Many may use Google Sheets to record customer contact information including the address data. Since one already maintains the spreadsheet, a tool that can automate the update of location record from a spreadsheet on Google Map may be a time-saver. And that's what has sparked my interest in creating a tool to address this problem.

## Product proposition
I created a program which opens a browser with an interface where users can instruct the program to select and position the desired location data on Google map. It then starts the automation process using the CSV data the user provided to add the locations on google map.
